# Model-based reinforcement learning

This repository contains code to benchmark model-based reinforcement learning solutions made of generative models and planning agents.

For each system in the `benchmark/` folder you can
- evaluate the models on static datasets with common regression metrics (likelihood, R2) by running `ramp-test` and
- evaluate the models coupled with planning agents in a classical model-based reinforcement learning setup by running `model-based-rl`.
